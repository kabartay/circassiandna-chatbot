  "Can BigY-700 results be used in other FTDNA tools?": "Yes, results can be used in projects, Y-DNA matches, and tools like Gloctrekker or YFull analysis.",
  "How does participating in FTDNA projects help Globtrekker?": "It adds more reference samples and refines migration maps for specific haplogroups.",
  "Are BigY-700 results updated over time?": "Yes, as new SNPs are discovered, your results can be reanalyzed for more accurate haplogroup placement.",
  "What is the advantage of combining STRs and BigY-700 SNPs?": "STRs help with genealogical matches in recent generations, while SNPs provide deep ancestry context for Gloctrekker.",
  "What is a good small set of questions to ask when evaluating a test provider?": "Ask about privacy, raw data access, SNP/STR coverage, sample storage policy, ability to export raw files, and sample retention policies.",
  "Best practice for preserving privacy when DNA testing": "Use test providers with clear privacy policies, consider not uploading raw data to unknown third-party sites, and review sharing and opt-in settings. Create a separate email for genetic services if preferred.",
  "Should I share my DNA data publicly?": "Sharing can help research but may risk privacy. Always read provider policies and anonymize data if possible. Only share with trusted projects or academic studies. For example, Circassian DNA Project is a good option.",

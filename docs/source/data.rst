Data files and knowledge base
=============================

.. note::
   These are literal views of the files in a repo. Paths assume the docs
   folder is at ``./``, not at ``docs/`` since files are at the repo root.
   If your layout differs, tweak the ``.. literalinclude::`` paths accordingly.

.. literalinclude:: ../../knowledgebase.json
   :language: json
   :linenos:
   :caption: knowledgebase.json
